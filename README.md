## 2. Machine Learning Problem

### 2.1 Type of Machine Learning Problem

This is a **Multi-Label Classification** problem. In multi-label classification, each sample (question) can belong to multiple labels (tags) simultaneously. 
For example, a question on Stack Overflow could be tagged with topics like `C`, `Pointers`, `FileIO`, or `memory-management`, or with no tags at all.
